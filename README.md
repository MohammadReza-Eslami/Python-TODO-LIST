# Python-TODO-LIST
First Python project: To-Do List with CSV and OOP
I decided to learn Python to master libraries like Biopython and apply these skills in bioinformatics for my research in genetics.  
This small project is my first step in learning Python and programming practices.

This project is a simple To-Do List application implemented in Python. It demonstrates:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with `Task` and `ToDoList` classes.
- Reading from and writing to CSV files.
- Adding, removing, and viewing tasks with a simple text menu.
- Setting priorities for tasks (High, Medium, Low).

Itâ€™s a console-based application that saves your tasks automatically and loads them when you reopen the program.
